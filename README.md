#### SUMMARY
Most employees at Emerald Tech are male which might raise the question of inclusion and diversity. Hence, the company should encourage more female applicants during recruitment. The 16% attrition rate is not encouraging for a company because the acceptable attrition rate in the industry is 10% or lower. There is no data on the reasons for attrition, hence it's prudent for the company to perform exit interviews or research. This will provide more insights into attritions and help in reducing the attrition rate. There is a need to direct the promotion policies to those regions with the worst attrition rate.
